# RTL Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of RTL (Register Transfer Level) design projects and Verilog practice exercises aimed at mastering digital logic design and hardware description languages. 
It includes a variety of projects ranging from basic combinational and sequential circuits, like multiplexers, decoders, and flip-flops, to advanced designs such as ALUs, FSMs, and memory modules. 
The repository also contains testbenches for verification and debugging, making it a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing RTL design.
